# IdeaList

IdeaList is the ideal place to store all your thoughts and ideas. Never lose track of a great idea again.

## Description

No matter what your hobby or job is, this has likely happened to you. You are at the grocery store, in the shower, waking up from a nap, coming back from a break, and you have an amazing idea! It  seems so incredible that it is impossible you will ever forget it. Later on you want to tell a friend about your stroke of genius, and you can't quite recall what made it so amazing. That twinge of regret is why I built IdeaList. IdeaList allows ordinary people to keep track of their extraordinary ideas. With your ideas all in one place, easily editable, and filterable by custom tags never lose track of an great idea again.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]. React-router-dom ensures snappy client side routing and minimizes server calls. This project also uses CSS styling to create a modern and responsive interface. Changes are persisted using a REST API hosted on Heroku.
